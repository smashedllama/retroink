# RetroInk

**RetroInk is a classic monochrome desktop-inspired e-reader firmware by
AltFlow, built on
[CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) 1.6.0 and
[CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).**

RetroInk keeps CrossInk's reading, library, transfer, dictionary, synchronization,
and accessibility features while presenting them through a memory-conscious
black-and-white interface designed for the Xteink X3 and X4. This independent
community project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple or Xteink.

RetroInk is distributed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and
[NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md) for license and project lineage details.

### Supported Devices

- Xteink X3
- Xteink X4
- Seeed Studio Sticky

**Not supported (yet):** the Xteink X4 Pro and X4 Classic.

#### X3 vs X4

Both run the same `firmware-x3-x4-*.bin`. The X3 has a clock chip that keeps counting while it sleeps; the original X4 has none and powers off completely when it sleeps, so it never knows the date or time. On an X4, Moon Phase, Earth, and Desk Calendar ask you to pick a date instead (Earth also takes a time and time zone); the date is saved and their sleep screens draw it. Features that need the real time as it passes are left out: the Clock accessory, the Today, Book Status, Book + Week, and Reading Year sleep screens, the daily reading goal and its countdown badge, and the header and reader clocks. A few things work slightly differently (Focus Session pauses while asleep, per-book stats and highlights aren't dated). [Full details](https://smashedllama.github.io/retroink/installation.html#x3-vs-x4).

The X4 Pro and X4 Classic use a different chip (ESP32-S3), so they aren't supported yet.

## What RetroInk adds

- A dedicated RetroInk interface with large, readable System 6-inspired type.
- Macintosh-style windows, menus, controls, dialogs, icons, and progress bars, covering every screen, not just a handful of them, on a desktop texture you choose from sixteen classic Mac patterns.
- A RetroInk boot sequence with an animated Macintosh glance.
- New sleep screens: the themed "resting between chapters" default, three playful Mac-style dialogs, reading-stats screens (Today, Book Status, Book + Week Stats, Reading Year), and desk-accessory screens (Moon Phase, Earth, Desk Calendar), plus monochrome book-cover rendering.
- An optional charging screen that appears automatically when you plug in and aren't actively reading.
- Code-drawn graphics that avoid extra framebuffers and large theme bitmaps.
- A Home screen with a progress bar on your current book, optional reading stats, and an OPDS Browser entry once you've added a server.
- A Finder-style Library for large nested collections: automatic reading shelves (To Read, Reading, Finished, Favorites), your own custom shelves you create and name yourself, title/filename/author/recent sorts, A-Z jumps, and a choice of shelf or icon view.
- A shelf-based way to browse the library on-device: books stand as spines on a shelf, Left/Right page through the current shelf, Up/Down switch straight to the next one, built in or custom, no menu in the way.
- Desk Accessories in the classic Mac sense: Moon Phase (drawn from a real lunar photo, with days until the next phase), Earth (a day/night globe for your time zone), an analog/digital Clock with a ticking seconds display, the fifteen-tile Puzzle, a tilt-controlled Marble Maze (X3), Desk Calendar, and System Info. Moon Phase and Earth can show any date you pick.
- Daily reading goals with a streak tracker and an in-reader countdown badge, plus a themed stats dashboard (Today, Reading Year, Book Status) when the System 6 theme is active.
- Focus Session, a configurable reading timer from 5 minutes to 24 hours, with Wi-Fi off while it runs.
- Adjustable status bar text size (Small, Medium, Large).
- Safe book moves across the device, web file manager, and WebDAV. RetroInk reviews old and current reading records before restoring progress after a move made elsewhere.
- [Obsidian Clipping Sync](./docs/obsidian-sync.md): pushes saved highlights into an Obsidian vault over the local network (via the Local REST API plugin) or a webhook, on top of the existing `/My Clippings.txt` export, including highlights saved before you set it up.
- Over-the-air updates from RetroInk's own releases, with the release notes shown before you install.
- A matching System 6 redesign of the on-device web portal (the page you get connecting over Wi-Fi in File Transfer mode), including a Library tab with drag-and-drop custom shelves.

## CrossInk foundation

RetroInk inherits CrossInk's typography, reading statistics, synchronization,
library, and reader improvements. The following features originate in that
foundation and remain available in RetroInk.

### Reader Fonts

The default fonts have been replaced with Lexend Deca and Bitter. These fonts have been chosen specifically to improve reading fluency and e-ink performance. These 'sturdier' typefaces feature uniform stroke weights and open geometries, allowing the X4/X3 to render crisp, high-contrast text with font-aliasing on while significantly reducing ghosting and artifacts.

- [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca) - A research-backed sans-serif typeface designed to improve reading fluency. Lexend was engineered based on the theory that reading issues are often a design problem (visual crowding) rather than a cognitive one.
- [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) - A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on digital screens. The consistent stroke weight of Bitter helps it render particularly well on e-ink devices. The medium weight has been chosen specifically for improved rendering on the X4/X3.

The UI now uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the display font which has improved readability at smaller sizes.

### Emojis and Misc Glyphs

- Support for a limited set of Unicode [Emoticons](https://unicode-explorer.com/b/1F600) and [Miscellaneous Symbols](https://unicode-explorer.com/b/2600) using [Noto Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji) and [Noto Sans Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Symbols) font.

---

### Font Sizes

CrossInk includes 10 pt, 12 pt, 14 pt, and 16 pt built-in reader font sizes.

See [SD Card Fonts](./docs/sd-card-fonts.md) for installing additional font families and size ranges.

---

### Reader features

Reader Options, Bionic Reading, Guide Dots, Force Paragraph Indents, reading stats, and finished-book behavior are documented in [Reader Features](./docs/reader-features.md).

### Custom button actions

CrossInk adds configurable button shortcuts.

See [Controls](./docs/controls.md) for the full action list and defaults.

## Tips for the best reading experience

CrossInk runs on an ESP32-C3 with limited RAM, so very large folders or complex EPUBs can be slower than they would be on a phone, tablet, or desktop app.

- Keep folders under about 200 files. For the smoothest browsing, aim for 50-100 files per folder.
- Having 1000+ books on the SD card is fine if they are split into smaller folders, such as by author, series, genre, or read/unread status.
- RetroInk Library can scan those nested folders and sort the full catalog by title; its first scan shows progress and resumes if you leave it.
- Avoid putting every book in the SD card root. The file browser has to scan and sort the current folder before it can show it.
- Text-first EPUBs are the best fit. Large image-heavy EPUBs, scanned books, comics, and omnibus files with thousands of sections may load slowly or fail under memory pressure.
- As a rough target, EPUBs under 20 MB tend to work the best. Files over 50 MB may still work, but they are more likely to be slow or memory-sensitive, especially if they contain many large images.
- If an EPUB is unusually slow, try [optimizing](./docs/webserver.md#epub-optimization) it with the built-in web optimizer (via File Transfer) before copying it to the SD card: remove unused high-resolution images, split very large omnibus files, and avoid embedding multiple full font families when possible.
- Use a reliable SD card and leave some free space. CrossInk stores settings, reading progress, cache files, stats, and generated book data on the card.

## Development Device Simulator

The [device simulator](https://github.com/uxjulia/crossink-simulator) renders the e-ink display in an SDL2 window so firmware changes can be sanity-checked without flashing hardware.

See [Simulator](./docs/simulator.md) for setup, platform notes, keyboard controls, and cache tips.

---

## Installation

Download a `firmware-x3-x4-*.bin` from [RetroInk's releases page](https://github.com/smashedllama/retroink/releases), then flash it with [Inky](https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools), the CrossInk-family web installer, or the command line.

See [Installation](./docs/installation.md) for step-by-step flashing and revert instructions.

## Development quick start

CrossInk uses PlatformIO for building and flashing firmware.

See [Getting Started](./docs/development/getting-started.md) for prerequisites, clone setup, and validation commands.

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

Connect your Xteink X4 or X3 via USB-C and run:

```sh
pio run -e default --target upload
```

Use `-e sticky` only when building for a Seeed Sticky device. The X3/X4 firmware uses the default environment.

See [Testing and Debugging](./docs/development/testing-debugging.md) for serial logging, simulator checks, static analysis, and bug-report guidance.

## Internals

The ESP32-C3 has about 380 KB of usable RAM, so CrossInk stores reusable book and device data on the SD card instead of rebuilding everything in memory.

See [Data Cache](./docs/data-cache.md) for the `.crosspoint` layout and [File Formats](./docs/file-formats.md) for binary cache details.

## Notice on Contributions

This repository does not accept pull requests. Feature requests may be opened in [discussions](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/discussions), but major features requiring ongoing support should be directed upstream to [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).
